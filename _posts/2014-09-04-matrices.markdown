Matrices are useful for writing linear systems more compactly. Instead of writing linear systems as:

<div>
$$1x_{1} + 2x_{2} = -1$$
$$3x_{1} + 4x_{2} = 0$$
$$5x_{1} + 6x_{2} = -5$$
</div>

We could write the linear systems using matrices:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\\\
3 & 4 \\\\
5 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{1} \\\\
x_{2}
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\\\
0 \\\\
5
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Matrix calculations

The four relevant operators are:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Scalar multiplication
4. Matrix multiplication

Addition and subtraction are straight-forward and work only with matrices that have the same dimensions. Scalar multiplication is also straight-forward; each element would be multiplied by a single number. Matrix multiplication, takes each row of the left factor and multiplies it with each column of the right factor. For example:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\\\
3 & 4 \\\\
5 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{1} & y_{1} \\\\
x_{2} & y_{2}
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1x_{1} + 2x_{2} & 1y_{1} + 2y_{2} \\\\
3x_{1} + 4x_{2} & 3y_{1} + 4y_{2} \\\\
5x_{1} + 6x_{2} & 5y_{1} + 6y_{2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

An $m \times n$ matrix multiplied by an $n \times p$ matrix, yields an $m \times p$ matrix. In the example above, the multiplication of a 3 by 2 matrix to a 2 by 2 matrix, yielded a 3 by 2 matrix. Furthermore, changing the order of factors usually results in a completely different product and matrices can only be multiplied if the number of columns in the left factor matches the number of row in the right factor.

### Special matrices

A **zero matrix** is a matrix where all elements are equal to zero.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

If we **transpose** this 2 by 3 matrix:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\\\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
$$

we get this 3 by 2 matrix:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 4 \\\\
2 & 5 \\\\
3 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Symmetric matrices** are square matrices that are symmetric around their main diagonals; a symmetric matrix is always equal to its transpose. For example:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\
1 & 2 & 4 & 4 \\\\
1 & 4 & 3 & 9 \\\\
1 & 4 & 9 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Triangular matrices** are square matrices in which the elements either above or below the main diagonal are all equal to zero. Here's an example of an **upper triangular matrix**:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\
0 & 2 & 4 & 4 \\\\
0 & 0 & 3 & 9 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Here's an example of a **lower triangular matrix**:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\
1 & 4 & 3 & 0 \\\\
1 & 4 & 9 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

A **diagonal matrix** is a square matrix in which all elements that are not part of its main diagonal are equal to zero. For example:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\
0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

**Identity matrices** are are square matrices with $n $ rows, where all elements on the main diagonal are equal to 1 and all other elements are 0. For example:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Multiplying a matrix with the identity matrix yields a product equal to the original matrix.

If the product of two square matrices is an identity matrix, then the two factor matrices are **inverses** of each other. For example:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\\\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix} \times
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} \\\\
x_{21} & x_{22}
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
